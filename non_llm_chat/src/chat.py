    This chatbot is powered by ChatterBot (no LLM required!) and can:
    â€¢ Have natural conversations and learn from them
    â€¢ Solve basic math problems (try: 'what is 5 + 3 * 2?')
    â€¢ Tell you the current time and date
    â€¢ Remember recent conversation history
    â€¢ Handle greetings, jokes, and general questions
    
    Try commands like: 'conversation history', 'clear history', 'tell me a joke', or ask math questions!
