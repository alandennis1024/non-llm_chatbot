    This chatbot uses pattern matching and rule-based responses (no LLM required!) and can:
    â€¢ Have natural conversations using pattern matching
    â€¢ Solve basic math problems (try: 'what is 5 + 3 * 2?')
    â€¢ Tell you the current time and date
    â€¢ Remember recent conversation history
    â€¢ Handle greetings, jokes, and general questions
    â€¢ Learn from conversations and store them in a local database
    
    Try commands like: 'conversation history', 'clear history', 'stats', 'tell me a joke', or ask math questions!
